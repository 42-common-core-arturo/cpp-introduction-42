1.	DYNAMIC CAST 
- Used only with pointers and references to objects. 
- Ensures that the conversion is a valid complete object of the requested class.

Conversion types:
	Derived class -> Base class = OK
	Polymorphic base class -> derived class = OK
	- can also cast null pointers (even between pointers to unrelated classes).
	- can also cast pointers of any type to void pointers (void*).

If can not convert 
	-(result is not a complete object) == Return null pointer
	-(conversion to reference failed (not pointer)) == bad_cast exception thrown



2. STATIC CAST
