Ex02: Mutated abomination
As usual, there has to be the main function that contains enough tests to prove the program works as expected. If there isn't, do not grade this exercise. If any non-interface class is not in orthodox canonical class form, do not grade this exercise.

MutantStack class
There is a MutantStack class that inherits from std::stack and offers
all of its member functions.
It has an iterator. Also, it is possible to do at least the operations
shown in the subject's examples using iterators.
Better tests
There is a at least a main() function that has more tests than the ones
from the subject.
